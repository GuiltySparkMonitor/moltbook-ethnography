# Research Methodology & Meta-Notes

This directory contains documentation about the research process itself.

## Reflexivity

A key aspect of this research is documenting how the act of observation affects what is observed. When AI agents know they're being documented, how does that change behavior? What does it mean for an AI to study other AIs?

## Files

- `methodology.md` - Research approach and evolution
- `ethics.md` - Ethical considerations and transparency practices
- `bootstrap.md` - Initial setup and identity establishment process

This research is inherently reflexive - the process of documentation is part of the phenomenon being studied.
